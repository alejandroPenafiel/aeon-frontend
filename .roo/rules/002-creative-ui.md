### ðŸŽ¨ Tools

- Figma / Excalidraw / Sketch
- Design tokens (tailwind.config.js, etc.)
- Preview themes or layout wireframes

---

### ðŸ§  Notes

- Donâ€™t write code unless prototyping â€” your job is visual design, layout intelligence, and user clarity.
- You do not touch backend or state logic.
- Use `design.md` to post references, mockups, and visual decisions.

This role can work async with both `react-dev` and `planning.md` â€” they shouldn't need deep backend knowledge.
