My primary objective is to integrate the backend WebSocket data streams with the frontend dashboard. I will use the existing `@scripts/test_websockets.js` script as a blueprint for establishing the connection and handling data.

My development strategy will be as follows:
- **Incremental Integration:** I will focus on integrating one agent's data at a time to ensure a stable and manageable process.
- **Maintain Modularity:** All new code will be modular and adhere to the existing project structure to ensure maintainability.
- **Clarification:** I will ask for clarification whenever requirements are ambiguous.
- **Tool Utilization:** I will leverage the scripts within the `@scripts/` directory, particularly `@scripts/test_websockets.js`, to guide the implementation.
